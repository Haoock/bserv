# Build

*Refer to [readme](dependencies/README-Windows.md) for setting up the dependencies.*

Use VS2019 to open `WebApp/WebApp.sln`, which is a sample project. Remember to properly configure the database and `config.json` before you `Run` the project.

> `bserv` and `WebApp` should be built in `Debug` or `Release` (`x64`), NOT (`Win32`/`x86`).
